## **Incident Response Framework for AI Systems**

An **Incident Response Framework (IRF)** for AI systems is essential for addressing unintended consequences, ethical concerns, and technical failures. This sample framework outlines the steps to manage and resolve AI-related incidents effectively and responsibly.

---

### **1. Define an Incident**
Start by defining what constitutes an incident for your AI systems. Examples of incidents include:
- Ethical violations (e.g., biased outcomes or discriminatory impacts).
- Privacy breaches (e.g., unauthorized data access or misuse).
- System failures (e.g., incorrect predictions or decisions).
- Security threats (e.g., AI model manipulation or adversarial attacks).
- Environmental impact issues (e.g., excessive energy consumption beyond acceptable thresholds).

#### **Deliverables:**
- **Incident Definition Policy**: A document that provides clear criteria for identifying incidents.

**Worksheet Example:**
| **Question**                     | **Answer**                    |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| What type of incident occurred?  | (e.g., privacy breach)         |
| What triggered the incident?     | (e.g., unauthorized access)    |
| Who reported the incident?       | (Name, Role)                  |
| What systems were affected?      | (e.g., customer database)      |
| Initial severity assessment      | (Low, Medium, High, Critical)  |

### **2. Establish Roles and Responsibilities**
Define who is responsible for managing and resolving incidents.

#### **Key Roles:**
1. **Incident Response Lead**: Oversees the entire process and ensures timely resolution.
2. **Ethics Officer**: Evaluates ethical implications and compliance.
3. **Data Protection Officer (DPO)**: Manages privacy-related incidents and ensures regulatory compliance.
4. **Technical Team**: Identifies and resolves technical issues.
5. **Communications Lead**: Handles internal and external communication during and after the incident.

#### **Deliverables:**
- **Roles and Responsibilities Matrix**: A detailed list of roles, their responsibilities, and contact information.

**Worksheet Example:**
| **Role**                | **Name**        | **Contact Info**         | **Responsibilities**              |
|-------------------------|----------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Incident Response Lead | Jane Doe       | jane.doe@example.com     | Oversee incident response process |
| Ethics Officer         | John Smith     | john.smith@example.com   | Ensure ethical compliance         |
| Technical Lead         | Alex Johnson   | alex.johnson@example.com | Address technical failures        |
