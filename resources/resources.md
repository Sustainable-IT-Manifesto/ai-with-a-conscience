**"Voice Recognition Still Has Significant Race and Gender Biases"**
* **Author**: Joan Palmiter Bajorek
* **Source**: Harvard Business Report
* **URL** https://hbr.org/2019/05/voice-recognition-still-has-significant-race-and-gender-biases

* **Summary**: As with facial recognition, web searches, and even soap dispensers, speech recognition is another form of AI that performs worse for women and non-white people. And speech recognition now influences important aspects of people’s lives, including immigration decisions, job hiring, and transportation, among many other things. That means that speech recognition accuracy — or lack thereof — could prevent you from immigrating to a new country, getting a job, or traveling safely. This is absolutely a matter of social injustice.  But if that alone doesn’t convince companies to fix the problem, they should consider that the accuracy of speech recognition also affects customer purchasing decisions. Remember that women and minorities have huge purchasing power — why wouldn’t companies want to solve this problem? It’s a missed business opportunity. And it’s something we all need to keep talking about.  Because these biases have serious consequences in people’s live, and because everyone deserves to have their voice heard.

**"Women, Find Your Voice"**
* **Author**:  Kathryn Heath, Jill Flynn and Mary Davis Holt
* **Source**: Harvard Business Report
* **URL**: https://hbr.org/2014/06/women-find-your-voice
* **Summary**: Even at the highest levels of organizations, many otherwise dynamic women struggle in meetings. Some say their voices are drowned out; others can’t find a way into the conversation at all. Their male counterparts perceive a problem, but they tend to dismiss it as resulting from timidity, defensiveness, lack of focus, or excessive emotion. Drawing on interviews, surveys, and decades of work as leadership coaches, the authors suggest steps women can take to feel more comfortable and become more effective. Women should master the “pre-meeting,” connecting with colleagues to test ideas and gather support; come to meetings armed with cogent comments and questions that can move the conversation forward; keep an even keel, speaking in measured tones and being careful not to signal frustration through sarcasm or curtness; and move past confrontation without taking it personally. Bosses can also help ensure that women’s voices are heard, by providing direct feedback about meeting behavior, inviting more women to the table, and proactively pulling women into the conversation. These changes can have profound results, enabling all team members, male and female, to contribute to their full potential.
